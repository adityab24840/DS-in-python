What is Stack?

A stack is a useful data structure in programming. It is just like a pile of plates kept on top of each other.
A stack works on  LIFO(Last In First Out)

Stack has  these Operations.

Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Top: Get the value of the top element without removing it

Working of Stack.

A pointer called TOP is used to keep track of the top element in the stack.
When stack is intilized, we set its value to -1 so that we can check if the stack is empty by comparing TOP == -1.
On PUSHING an element, we increase the value of TOP and place the new element in the position pointed to by TOP.
On POPPING an element, we return the element pointed to by TOP and reduce its value.
Before PUSHING, we check if the stack is already full and before POPPING, we check if the stack is already empty
